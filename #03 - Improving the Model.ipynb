    "In the last mission, we explored how to use a simple k-nearest neighbors machine learning model that used just one feature, or attribute, of the listing to predict the rent price. We first relied on the **accommodates** column, which describes the number of people a living space can comfortably accommodate. Then, we switched to the **bathrooms** column and observed an improvement in accuracy. While these were good features to become familiar with the basics of machine learning, it's clear that using just a single feature to compare listings doesn't reflect the reality of the market. An apartment that can accommodate 4 guests in a popular part of Washington D.C. will rent for much higher than one that can accommodate 4 guests in a crime ridden area.\n",
